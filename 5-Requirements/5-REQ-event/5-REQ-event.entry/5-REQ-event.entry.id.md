# event.entry.id: Unique Event-Entry

**References:**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 2

If an event is set, a unique entry must be created to distinguish between multiple event instances with the same ID.
To ensure the event-entry is unique, the entry must have a UUID assigned to it.
