# qa.pipeline: Pipeline to ensure a high library quality

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

A QA pipeline that is run on every PR and push to *main* ensures higher code quality.\
Running pipeline steps in a defined sequence prevents unnecessary checks, which improves sustainability (see: [<req>qa.sustain](5.a-REQact-qa#qasustain-consider-sustainability-during-design-and-development)).

## qa.pipeline.1_style: Ensure consistent formatting

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

`cargo fmt` is used to ensure consistent code styling, and reduces review times, because code can be formatted automatically.

## qa.pipeline.2_lint: 

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

`cargo clippy` is used to as linter to ensure good code quality.

## qa.pipeline.3_build:

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

`cargo build` is used to ensure that the code still compiles.

## qa.pipeline.4_tests:

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

`cargo test` is used to run all *evident* tests.

**Implementation Notes:** `cargo test -- --test-threads 1` is used, because tests cannot be run in parallel as tests use the same events and publisher.
