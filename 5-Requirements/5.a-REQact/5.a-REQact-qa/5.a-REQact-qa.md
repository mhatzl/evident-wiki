# qa: Quality Assurance

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

*QA* requirements help to ensure a high quality for *evident*.

**Note:** General *QA* requirements affect the overall architecture and implementation of *evident*, because they are not specific to a feature/functionality. Therefore, these requirements must be considered for every existing or new feature/functionality, as long as these *QA* requirements are *active*.

**Note:** Only general *QA* requirements should be part of this requirement group. *QA* requirements that are specific to a requirement group should be added to a *qa* requirement subgroup for this feature.

## qa.perf: Performance considerations

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

The performance penalty for using *evident* should be as low as possible, especially for capturing events, because capturing most likely happens during execution of business logic.

### qa.perf.locks: Performance impact of multithreaded locking

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

Use as few write-locks as possible, and prefer `RwLock` over `Mutex`.

**Note:** `RwLock` allows multiple read-locks on the same shared data.

## qa.ux: User experience considerations

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

*evident* should be easy to set up basic pub/sub functionalities, while allowing enough flexibility to customize the event data that is sent.

### qa.ux.macros: Use macros if it improves usability

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

Rust macros may be used if they improve the usability of *evident*.
However, IDE support for macros is not as good as for functions, so wherever possible try to use functions instead of macros.
