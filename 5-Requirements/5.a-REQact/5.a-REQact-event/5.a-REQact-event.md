# event: Structure of an *evident* event

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to publish and subscribe to events, to create an event-driven architecture.

## event.id: Event Identifier

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

**Note:** Every event needs a unique ID for subscribers to subscribe to.

As a user, I want to be able to adapt the ID per pub/sub instance, to be able to define what makes an ID unique per instance.

## event.msg: Event Message

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to be able to adapt the message structure, that is sent when publishing an event, per pub/sub instance, because the message content might differ between instances.

## event.entry: Event Entry

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to be able to add additional content to an event besides the event message, because content may be added conditionally.
