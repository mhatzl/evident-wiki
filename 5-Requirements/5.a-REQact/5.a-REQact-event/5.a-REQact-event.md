# event: Structure of an *evident* event

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to publish and subscribe to events, to create an event-driven architecture.

## event.msg: Event Message

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to be able to adapt the message structure, that is sent when publishing an event, per pub/sub instance, because the message content might differ between instances.

## event.set: Set an event

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to set an event, because I want to notify subscribers.

## event.origin: Get the event origin

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

As a user, I want to know the crate, module, and line number the event was set at, because this enables more filter options.

**Implementation Details:** Macros must be used to get the event origin directly without user interaction.
