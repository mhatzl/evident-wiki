# qa.ux.macros: Use macros if it improves usability

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

Rust macros may be used if they improve the usability of *evident*.
However, IDE support for macros is not as good as for functions, so wherever possible try to use functions instead of macros.
