# qa.sustain: Consider sustainability during design and development

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 

Sustainability is becoming more and more important.
Therefore, sustainability should be considered during design decisions and development of *evident*.

**Note:** Also during development, because e.g. CI/CD-pipelines may unnecessarily waste resources.
