# subs.all: Subscribe to all events

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 2 (2 direct)

As a user, I want to be able to subscribe to all events, because I might not know what events could get set, or because I want to be able to react to any set event.

## subs.all.test.any: Receive any event if subscribed to all

A set event is received by a subscriber that is set up to receive all set events. 

## subs.all.test.mult: Receive multiple different events with a subscriber to all events

Multiple events are set, and all are received by a subscriber that is set up to receive all set events.
