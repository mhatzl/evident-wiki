# subs.specific: Subscribe to specific events

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 5 (1 direct)

As a user, I want to be able to subscribe to specific events, because I am either only interested in certain events, or because I want to react differently depending on the received event.

## Implementation Details

Since events are identified using an event-ID, this ID must be used for subscriptions.

## Sub-requirements

- [req:subs.specific.mult](5-REQ-subs.specific.mult)
- [req:subs.specific.one](5-REQ-subs.specific.one)
