# event.entry.id_v2: Use atomic counter as unique ID

**Declined reason:** Benchmarks showed performance decrease using an atomic counter instead of UUID. Probably because of read/write-locking of the counter.

To remove the UUID dependency in the *evident* API, the entry-ID should be replaced by an atomic counter.
This atomic counter increases on every new event-entry that is created to ensure that every entry gets a unique ID.
