# cap.ctrl: Control Capturing

**References**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 13 (3 direct)

As a user, I want to start and stop capturing during runtime, because I might not want to capture events during certain operations.

## Sub-requirements

- [req:cap.ctrl.info](5-REQ-cap.ctrl.info)
- [req:cap.ctrl.init](5-REQ-cap.ctrl.init)
- [req:cap.ctrl.start](5-REQ-cap.ctrl.start)
- [req:cap.ctrl.stop](5-REQ-cap.ctrl.stop)
