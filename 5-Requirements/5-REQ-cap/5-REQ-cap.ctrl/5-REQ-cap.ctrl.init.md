# cap.ctrl.init: Initial Capturing State

**References:**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/evident/tree/main): 1 (1 direct)

As a user, I want that capturing is active per default, otherwise, every library user would need to start capturing manually. 

## cap.ctrl.init.test: Capturing is turned on by default

Events are captured without manually starting capturing.
